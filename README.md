### About Me

After attending a great coding bootcamp ([CodeClan](http://www.codeclan.com)), I'm in my first year as a Junior Developer but I've been coding in various ways since I was a teenager.
This is an evolving list of free resources for people starting out. I'm including books, articles, interactive tutorials, and anything I have found useful.


### Disclaimer
I work primarly making webapps. I am not super familiar with native mobile app development. These resources are primarily about familiarising oneself with the basic principles of programming, and the architecture of websites and web apps.

This list is intended for *total beginners*. They're resources I've found along my journey that I have found particularly useful. I am sure there are other excellent resources avaiable and I'd love to hear about them. This list currently only includes resources I've used so they are genuine recommendations.

#### <a name="interactive-tutorials"></a> Interactive Tutorials

* **Learn.co**
  * This is the best introduction I have found for total beginners. The reason it's so good is that it immediately places you in an environment analogous to one you'd be using as an actual developer. It mandates that you use git, and test driven development - two essential processes. Learn.co also has a fantastic community of learners, and a live chat functionality where other students will help you out when you get stuck. [Learn.co](https://learn.co/sign_up)


* **Udacity: Intro to HTML and CSS**
 * Udacity is an online learning portal, full of classes on all kinds of technical subjects. While they offer paid ongoing "nanodegree" programs, there is a wealth of free courses available. This course is a good introduction to the basic structure of a webpage and how to make things appear on it! It has a good combination of short videos and practical exercises, so I found it easy to follow and fit into my schedule.

#### <a name="books"></a>Books

* **Learn Ruby The Hard Way - Zed Shaw**
 * Zed Shaw's series of books cover multiple languages and technologies, and the Ruby instance is available for free. Shaw emphasizes practical work, large amounts of typing and reading code and he provides some great techniques for helping knowledge stick and learning how to spot mistkaes in your code. This series was what helped me really become comfortable with writing code, and it's a perfect way in for a total beginner to immerse themelves in coding.

 * **Learn To Program - Chris Pine**
   * *Learn To Program* was recommended as part of the course prep work at my bootcamp, and it's a great introduction to the basic concepts of programming. Pine uses Ruby but covers concepts that are included in pretty musc every programming language. It is pitched at complete beginners and goes through concepts clearly, with plenty of exercises to consolidate your learning. The free version is available [here](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) and it's possible to purchase a paid version with extra content and exercises.




#### <a name="talks"></a> Talks
* **Stuff Everybody Knows Except You - Laurie Voss**
 * Laurie Voss of npm gave this talk at a bootcamp and it's the perfect thing to watch as a junior developer. Subtitled "A flythrough guide to Web Development's best practices", it covers topics that might be alien to a total beginner but are important to understand as soon as possible. These include debugging, databases and security. It's a whirlwind tour through a lot of aspects of programming, is super insightful, very accessible and most importantly, funny.

 * A helpful person turned it into a infographic [here](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/infographic-laurie-voss-things-everyone-knows-except-you).


* **Life As A Developer: My Code Does Not Work Because I Am A Victim Of Complex Societal Factors That Are Beyond My Control…. - James Mickens**
 * One of my favourite things that happened as a side effect of my learning to program was that I became aware of James Mickens. A Harvard professor, Microsft engineer and security expert, Mickens delivers tech talks that do not linger too long on any particular topic and are extremely funny musings on programming and the tech industry. I have watched plenty of actual comedy that is much less funny that this talk. This talk conveys the fun and black humour that often comes along with life as a programmer.

#### <a name="blogs-articles"></a>Blogs and Articles
* **Base CS**
 * BaseCS is a fantastic series of illustrated posts about computer science fundamentals by progammer and writer [Vaidehi Joshi](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi). She uses pictures, analogies and examples to make concepts including different types of data structures and algorithms accessbile to beginners. [Base CS](https://medium.com/basecs)

#### <a name="podcasts"></a>Podcasts
* **Base CS**
 * The great article series is a now a podcast! Vaidehi and Saron Yitbarek of CodeNewbie cover the topics in the articles and more. I cannot overstate how useful this podcast is for friendly and clear explanations of concepts that initally seem scary. [Base CS Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)


* **CodeNewbie**
 * Code Newbie is a fun, open and diverse community of people all learning to code. The founder of the community - the amazing Saron Yitbarek - hosts this podcast. Every week she interviews someone from the world of coding, covering everything from the ethics of coding to getting your first job as a developer to accesibility. These interviews are all conducted with noobs in mind, so they become interesting deep dives, while remaining accessible. [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)
